    "# Objective: To test the candidate's knowledge of Python Lists and Tuples, and their ability to manipulate and extract information from them.\n",
    "# Instructions:\n",
    "# Create a Python script that performs the following tasks:\n",
    "# Create a list of integers called numbers with the following values: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "# Create a tuple of strings called words with the following values: (\"hello\", \"world\", \"python\", \"coding\", \"bootcamp\")\n",
    "# Use the numbers list and the words tuple to create a new list called result which contains the following values: [1, \"hello\", 2, \"world\", 3, \"python\", 4, \"coding\", 5, \"bootcamp\", 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]\n",
    "# Use the result list to extract the following sublists:\n",
    "# The sublist containing the values from index 2 to index 5\n",
    "# The sublist containing the last 5 elements of the result list\n",
    "# Use the result list to extract the following elements:\n",
    "# The element at index 4\n",
    "# The element at the last index of the result list\n",
    "# Use the result list to count the number of occurrences of the string \"python\"\n",
    "# Use the result list to determine if the integer 3 is present in the list\n",
    "# Use the result list to remove the element at index 4\n",
    "# Use the result list to insert the string \"programming\" at index 6\n",
    "# Use the result list to sort the list in ascending order\n",
    "# Use the result list to reverse the order of the elements in the list\n",
    "# Use the result list to convert it to a tuple called final_tuple\n",
    "# The script should be well-organized and commented on and should include appropriate error handling.\n",
    "# The script should be submitted as a single .py file.\n",
    "# Evaluation Criteria:\n",
    "# The script successfully performs all the tasks outlined in the instructions\n",
    "# The script is well-organized, commented, and includes appropriate error handling\n",
    "# The script demonstrates a clear understanding of Python Lists and Tuples and their manipulation\n",
    "# Good luck!"
